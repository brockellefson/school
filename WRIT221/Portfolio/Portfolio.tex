"In the big pizza wheel of life, sometimes you're the burnt crust
 and sometimes you're the bubbly cheese."

Life is not fair, most people will not reap what they sow, 
there is no karma or morale police. There will be times that
you're a hero and there will be times that you're a villain.
That's the great part, none of this is predestined, every morning 
I wake up in my apartment that is too small, go to my college that's
too expensive, then clock in for my shift at a job where I am paid 
too little. However I can still find a way to reinvent myself everyday.
\end{verbatim}


\subsection*{1/19/17}
\begin{verbatim}
"Pain is easy when the reason is clear"

Sometimes the right choice to make is not the one with the least
resistance. Be honest with yourself, is this what you want?
Is she what you want?
No. 
Then let her go. 
It will be horrible for a few weeks.
And those few weeks could turn into a few months, 
and those few months could turn into a year,
but that's better than a lifetime of regret. 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{2/21/17}
\begin{verbatim}
"He is sick of dispensing warnings to the careless"

I'm very drawn to this line, it seems that the ranger keeps giving advice
to people who either won't listen, or to whom simply don't care. It's
gotten him to the breaking point where he is now become very jaded about
what he once lived for, helping people in need.

Report Card:
Romance: D
Listening to an album non-stop for a month: A+
Being a smartass: B
Making microwave dinners: B+
Drinking beer: A
Playing an uncomfortable amount of video games: A+

Brock seems to focus on music and videogames, which are very valuable areas
for a growing boy, but he really needs to work on his love life. He talks
to girls all the time but never seems to commit to any one person. 
Luckily, he does have skills that could help him attract a potential mate.
Such as, drinking beer and making microwave dinners; both areas where he 
succeeds. Brock is a bit of a smartass, but I can appreciate that

\subsubsection*{3/30/17}
\begin{verbatim}
"There are few things wholly evil or wholly good"

Basically, no one is born evil, but that the same time, no one is born
righteous. Everyone begins as a blank canvas, your experiences are 
what shape your personality into a beautiful painting.
Everything else is just basecoat of the acrylic.

I really enjoyed the writing of the day. I would consider myself a less professional writer and a lot stronger in creative style writing, so these beginning of the day creative writing pieces was a lot of fun for me, since I could write a little more comfortably with my strengths. However I feel like five minutes was not a large enough block of time to write complete thoughts with the material presented. In the future, I feel like if the class was using a little less complex writing topics and focuses or give us more time. That might just be a personal preference, I feel like I'm a little slower, more methodical writer in comparison to others, so I need more time to write a completely thought out, well structured paragraph. To me, five minutes just isn't enough time to read a poem, pick apart the symbolism and entendres, then pick a favorite line and talk about why that line is my favorite of the piece.\\

It's difficult for me to make a choice on which one of my daily writings was my favorite. I really enjoyed the day when we listened to a song for about a minute and then wrote a small story based on the mood and mindset we were put in after listening to the song. I thought that was a really creative exercise, and it was really interesting how almost each student had a similar settings (i.e. almost everyone had a western theme when Marty Robbins played) yet their characters and plot were all extremely different and branched out in numerous ways. Then after three songs one master editor would combine some portion of three snippets of three students different stories into one massive 'Pulp Fiction' esc. story. I just really enjoyed that daily writing. However, my favorite part about the daily writings was not a specific writing itself but all of them as a whole. My voice and tone changed dramatically over the course of the semester. I was going through a lot of personal issues at the begging of the semester, so my tone of a lot of my writing was very dark, cynical, and monotone. Yet as the semester went on, my voice became more and more lighthearted and optimistic. Having a physical copy me periodically feeling better and better is really, really cool. Even reading through my five favorite daily writings I chose, you can see the tone changing ever so slightly each iteration. I think that is great.
