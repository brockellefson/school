\maketitle
I would change the layout. All these columns make these a chore to read. Not a fan. Also this document is using a lot of filler words that are unnecessary. \\For Example:\\
The Farm Service Agency (FSA) developed the Microloan (ML) program to better serve the unique financial operating needs of beginning, niche and the smallest of family farm operations by modifying its Operating Loan (OL) application, eligibility and security requirements.
\\
Change this to:
\\
The Farm Service Agency developed Microloans to serve unique financial operating needs of family farm operations by modifying its Operating Loan application, eligibility, and security requirements.
