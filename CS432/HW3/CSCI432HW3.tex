\section{What is the loop invariant of the while loop in dutchFlagPartition?}
A.subList(0, smaller) $\leq$ A.sublist(smaller, equal) $\leq$ A.sublist(equal, larger) $\leq$ A.(larger, A.size())

\section{Given an array A of n objects
with boolean-valued keys, what is an algorithm to reorder
the array so that objects that have a FALSE key
appear first? The relative ordering of objects with
the same key should remain the same (in words, this
should be a stable sorting algorithm). Use O(1) additional
space and O(n) time.}

\section{Suppose you have an unfair
coin, where the probability of landing heads (H) is
25 and the probability of tails (T) is 75.}

\subsection{What is the expected number of coin tosses until one head
turns up?}

Well, since theres a 75\% if getting a tails, our expected number of flips is 4 

\section{What is the expected number of coin tosses
needed in order to obtain three consecutive heads.}
T = $\frac{3}{4}$ \\
HT = $\frac{3}{16}$ 




X = $\dfrac{1-p^{h}}{p^{h}(1-p)}$\\\\
X = $\dfrac{1-.25^{3}}{.25^{3}(1-.25)}$ = 84\\\\
