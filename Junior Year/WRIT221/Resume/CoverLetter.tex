Dear Oldcastle\\\\
My name is Brock Ellefson, I saw your listing for a Process Engineering Intern this summer and am very interested.  \\ 


This is currently my fourth year studying Computer Science at Montana State University. Despite being an undergraduate, I have demonstrable  experience in programming. I am not the next Bill Gates nor Vint Cerf however I am very passionate about computer science, constantly pushing myself to expand my knowledge of coding. I programmed my first 2D game from scratch on Blitz Basic. It was complete with sprites as well as custom-made sounds. Right now I've recently began process of independently developing an indie game on the Unity 3d engine in my spare time.\\   


An old boss of mine Samuel Quick, a network administrator, always thought merging my people skills with my knowledge of programming would be the best course for me. Hopefully you consider me a qualified applicant. Attached is my resume, feel free to contact me via cell phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.


Thank you for your time, \\
Brock
