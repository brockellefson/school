% This is a simple template for a LaTeX document using the "article" class.
% See "book", "report", "letter" for other types of document.

\documentclass[11pt]{article} % use larger type; default would be 10pt

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % set input encoding (not needed with XeLaTeX)

%%% Examples of Article customizations
% These packages are optional, depending whether you want the features they provide.
% See the LaTeX Companion or other references for full information.

%%% PAGE DIMENSIONS
\usepackage{geometry} % to change the page dimensions
\geometry{a4paper} % or letterpaper (US) or a5paper or....
% \geometry{margin=2in} % for example, change the margins to 2 inches all round
% \geometry{landscape} % set up the page for landscape
%   read geometry.pdf for detailed page layout information

\usepackage{graphicx} % support the \includegraphics command and options

% \usepackage[parfill]{parskip} % Activate to begin paragraphs with an empty line rather than an indent

%%% PACKAGES
\usepackage{booktabs} % for much better looking tables
\usepackage{array} % for better arrays (eg matrices) in maths
\usepackage{paralist} % very flexible & customisable lists (eg. enumerate/itemize, etc.)
\usepackage{verbatim} % adds environment for commenting out blocks of text & for better verbatim
\usepackage{subfig} % make it possible to include more than one captioned figure/table in a single float
% These packages are all incorporated in the memoir class to one degree or another...

%%% HEADERS & FOOTERS
\usepackage{fancyhdr} % This should be set AFTER setting up the page geometry
\pagestyle{fancy} % options: empty , plain , fancy
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} % customise the layout...
\lhead{}\chead{}\rhead{}
\lfoot{}\cfoot{\thepage}\rfoot{}

%%% SECTION TITLE APPEARANCE
\usepackage{sectsty}
\allsectionsfont{\sffamily\mdseries\upshape} % (See the fntguide.pdf for font help)
% (This matches ConTeXt defaults)

%%% ToC (table of contents) APPEARANCE
\usepackage[nottoc,notlof,notlot]{tocbibind} % Put the bibliography in the ToC
\usepackage[titles,subfigure]{tocloft} % Alter the style of the Table of Contents
\renewcommand{\cftsecfont}{\rmfamily\mdseries\upshape}
\renewcommand{\cftsecpagefont}{\rmfamily\mdseries\upshape} % No bold!

%%% END Article customizations

%%% The "real" document content comes below...

\title{CSCI 305 HW0}
\author{Brock Ellefson}
%\date{} % Activate to display a given date or no date (if empty),
         % otherwise the current date is printed

\maketitle

\section{Regular Expressions and DFA}
Either nothing or exactly one a followed by exactly one b; the ab pattern can be repeated. Example outputs: ab, ababababab, ababab

$\varepsilon$
$\vert$(ab)*
\section{Set Operations}
	\subsection{A $\cup$ B}
	$\{$1,2,2,3,3,5$\}$
	\subsection{A $\cap$ B}
	$\{$2,3$\}$
	\subsection{A $\backslash$ B}
	$\{$1$\}$
\section{Symbolic Notation}
For all x's that are real, there exists a y that x that is greater than y and y in the subset z
\section{Basic Algorithms and Data Structures}
Assuming these are sorted least to greatest
\subsection {}
If L is empty then make the node as head and return it.


If value of the element is smaller than the head node then this element to be inserted will now be the head.


In a loop starting at the head, check current value of each node, iterate until you find a node with a value greater than this new element to be inserted. Insert new node before node of greater value

This will be completed in O$(\,$n$)\,$
\subsection{}
This can be achieved by using Binary Search.  O$(\,$logn$)\,$

Check the value of the middle element of the array

If it is greater than mid value, check the value of the middle of mid and end of array.


If it is less than mid value, check the value of the middle of mid and beggining of array 


repeat until 'mid' is equal to element you are trying to find, if it is never equal, the value does not exist in the array.

\section{Code Understanding}
This code takes a array (size 12 in this case) with each element being a random size of 1-10 and finds the largest and smallest value.
