Question 1: What did you get when running f with the input above?
-[13,12,11,10,9,8]

Question 2: What does this function f do?
-given an array 'list', it will iterate through the list adding k to each element

Question 3: What does [10, 9..5] do?
-create an array from 10 to 5. [10,9,8,7,6,5]

Question 4: Given a comment that explains the line following (a).
-if 'list' is empty.

Question 5: Given a comment that explains the line following (b).
-then return an empty list

Question 6: Given a comment that explains the line following (c).
-iterate through each element in the array and add k to the value

Question 7:
-I like how few lines it takes to accomplish something. In other words, pattern matching and list comprehension are very cool.

Question 8:
-Everything. Even the simplest task took me forever. I understood and knew how to do everything, however it took my forever to look up correct syntaxes for it and overall felt awkward typing out all my methods.

Question 9:
-About 10 hours honestly :(
I had to look up a ton of material about intersection and set eq in order to understand how to type these out properly in haskell
Question 10:
No

Question 11:
No
